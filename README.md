# Countdown Timer  Project⏰

This was my **very first front-end project** — a simple and clean **Countdown Timer** for a **car giveaway**! 🏁🚘

I built it using:

- 🧱 **HTML**
- 🎨 **CSS**
- 🧠 **JavaScript**

It displays a countdown to a target date and dynamically updates the time left in **days, hours, minutes, and seconds**. ⌛⏱️
